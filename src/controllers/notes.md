## SORTING OPTIONS
1. SORT BY LAST UPDATED

## FILTER OUT BEFORE SHOWING USER
1. -linked:pr
2. no:assignee
3. is:open / state:open


## FILTERING OPTIONS
SO YOU CAN QUERY GITHUB API KINDA LIKE JQL FOR JIRA,
✔ FILTER BY LANGUAGE => LANGUAGE:TS/JS/RUBY/ETC, 
✔ FILTER FOR TERMS IN BODY OF ISSUE => TESTS IN:BODY 
✔ FILTER BY PRIORITY LABELS => LABEL:PRIORITY
✔ SEARCH THINGS THAT HAVE NO SOMETHING => NO:ASSIGNEE, NO:LABEL
✔ SEARCH WORDS IN THE TITLE, BODY, OR COMMENTS => WORDS IN:TITLE/BODY/COMMENTS
✔ FILTER OUT ISSUES LINKED TO A PR => -LINKED:PR
✔ FILTER OUT ISSUES THAT HAVE SOMETHING => -LABEL:RESOLVED, -STATE:CLOSED, ETC

IDEA IS TO LET USER CONTROL/CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT TO FILTER BY
SO ON THE FRONT END, WE WILL HAVE A FORM WITH BUTTONS/TEXTBOXES TO LET USERS TELL WHAT ISSUES THEY WANT TO SEE
I.E.
    LABELS => BUTTONS FOR EACH LABEL, THEY CAN CHOOSE MORE THAN 1
    KEYWORDS => TEXTBOX, THEY ENTER TEXT THEY WANT TO SEE CONTAINED WITHIN (TITLE, BODY, OR COMMENTS? BUTTONS FOR THOSE?)
