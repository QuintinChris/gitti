# Plan
- [ ]  Fetch info from GitHub API
    - [X]  GET issues
    - [ ]  Filter
        - [ ]  tags = good-first-issue, help-wanted, etc
        - [ ]  Custom filtering on descriptions including "YOUR_TEXT_HERE"
- [ ]  Configure refreshing API calls
    - [ ]  i.e. make sure the results update as soon as a new issue is created/tagged
    - [ ]  how do we make a continuous API call? or a call the updates once the results change?
- [ ]  Configure email notifications
- [ ]  Configure UI
    - [ ]  use react with ts
    - [ ]  simple register/login form kinda thing, users can choose what kind of issues they want to receive notifications on, enter their email, they're preferences are saved
        - [ ]  Note: we will need to set up a DB for this
    - [ ]  make a simple front-end that would display the issues for users to sift through, simple issue cards, scrollable
- [ ]  Configure SMS notifications (using Twilio API)
- [ ]  Configure Stripe billing for premium version
- [ ]  Host online
    - [ ]  AWS S3? Lambda? Definitely will need to research this
- [ ]  Done! ðŸŽ‰
